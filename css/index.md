0. Before to think about class name, choose a good name for HTML elements
1. Put the class name at the lowest possible level
2. Use content to find a name
3. Don’t use content, if the picture speaks louder
4. Try -like suffix for better reuse.
5. Don’t use camelCase
6. Try BEM
7. Try more uglier
8. Use fully descriptive words
9. Try to use only one letter as a meaningful prefix
10. Try [] when too many classes of a kind
11. Use a js- prefix if it is only used by JavaScript
12. Try to separate parent from children
13. Unsemantic classes should explicitly describe their properties
14. Explicit hacks (I)
15. Explicit hacks (II)
16. Try to avoid more than two words for a given name
17. Use data-state attribute to specify state of your component
18. Use has- or is- prefix for the state
19. Use a dash as a prefix when combining multiple state
20. Try single quote instead of double quote when declaring selector in HTM
21. Don’t follow rules
	- 1) Try to improve your naming, 
	- 2) keep it consistent for a given project, 
	- 3) but avoid over-engineering.

If you don’t feel comfortable, just skip it.
