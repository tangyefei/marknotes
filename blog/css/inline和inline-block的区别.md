### 3.1 display

- what's difference between `inline` and `inline-block` 


	Elements with display:inline-block are like display:inline elements, but they can have a width and a height. That means that you can use an inline-block element as a block while flowing it within text or other elements.


	Difference of supported styles as summary:

	- inline: only margin-left, margin-right, padding-left, padding-right
	- inline-block: margin, padding, height, width
